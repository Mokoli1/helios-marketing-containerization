## 💼 Interview Talking Points

### Technical Deep Dive Questions

**Q: "Walk me through your containerization approach"**
```
A: "I implemented a multi-stage Docker build starting with a Node.js base for 
future asset compilation, then copying to an optimized Nginx Alpine image. 
This approach reduces final image size while maintaining build flexibility. 
I also implemented non-root user execution and comprehensive health checks."
```

**Q: "How did you ensure production readiness?"**
```
A: "I focused on five key areas:
1. Security: Non-root containers, vulnerability scanning, security headers
2. Monitoring: Custom health checks with multiple validation levels
3. Performance: Nginx optimization, compression, caching strategies
4. Reliability: Automated testing, rollback capabilities, SLA monitoring
5. Observability: Structured logging, metrics collection, alerting"
```

**Q: "Describe your CI/CD pipeline"**
```
A: "The pipeline includes:
- Code quality checks (linting, validation)
- Security scanning (Trivy, secret detection)
- Multi-architecture Docker builds
- Automated testing (integration, performance, security)
- Staged deployments (staging → production)
- Post-deployment verification
All with proper error handling and rollback mechanisms."
```

### DevOps Philosophy Questions

**Q: "How do you approach Infrastructure as Code?"**
```
A: "This project demonstrates IaC through Docker Compose configurations,
GitHub Actions workflows, and documented deployment procedures. Everything
is version-controlled, reproducible, and environment-agnostic."
```

**Q: "What's your monitoring strategy?"**
```
A: "I implemented a three-tier approach:
1. Application health checks with custom validation
2. Container-level monitoring with resource tracking
3. Infrastructure monitoring with log aggregation
This provides comprehensive visibility from code to infrastructure."
```
