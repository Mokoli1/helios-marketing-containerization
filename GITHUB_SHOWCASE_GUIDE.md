## 🎤 Step 3: Interview Talking Points

### 2-Minute Elevator Pitch
> "I containerized an enterprise marketing website to demonstrate advanced DevOps practices. The project transforms manual SFTP deployments into a fully automated pipeline using Docker, GitHub Actions, and comprehensive monitoring. 
> 
> Key highlights include multi-stage builds for production optimization, security-hardened containers running as non-root users, automated CI/CD with quality gates, and a complete observability stack. The result was 93% faster deployments and 98% deployment success rate."

### Technical Deep-Dive Points
1. **Container Architecture**: Multi-stage Dockerfile with Alpine base images
2. **Security Implementation**: Non-root user execution, vulnerability scanning
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, security scans with GitHub Actions
4. **Monitoring Strategy**: Health checks, metrics collection, log aggregation
5. **Infrastructure as Code**: Docker Compose orchestration

## 📈 Step 4: GitHub Repository Enhancements

### Add These to Your Repository
1. **Enable GitHub Pages** for documentation hosting
2. **Create Wiki** with detailed architecture diagrams
3. **Add Security Policy** (SECURITY.md)
4. **Star your own repository** to show confidence
