# Product Requirements Document: Marketing Site Modernization (Phase 1)

**Project Title:** Marketing Site Containerization & Deployment Automation  
**Company:** Helios Observability, Inc.  
**Author:** DevOps Engineering  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 21, 2025  

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for Phase 1 of the Helios Observability marketing website modernization project. The current deployment process for helios-observability.com is manual, slow, and error-prone, creating a significant bottleneck for the marketing team and posing a risk to site stability. This initiative aims to address these inefficiencies by containerizing the website and establishing the foundation for a modern, automated CI/CD workflow.

## 2. Problem Statement

As detailed in the project case study, the reliance on manual SFTP deployments leads to slow release cycles, inconsistent development vs. production environments, and a lack of version control, making rollbacks nearly impossible. This manual process is not scalable, secure, or reliable enough to support the company's rapid growth and marketing initiatives.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

The primary business goal is to increase deployment velocity and reliability for the marketing website.

The technical objectives for this phase are:

1. **Standardize the Environment:** Create a portable, consistent runtime environment for the website using containerization.

2. **Automate the Build Process:** Develop a repeatable, automated process for packaging the website into a distributable artifact.

3. **Enable Local Development Parity:** Ensure that developers can run an exact replica of the production environment on their local machines.

4. **Establish a CI Foundation:** Lay the technical groundwork for a future automated Continuous Integration pipeline.

## 4. User Stories

- **As a Marketing Developer,** I want to run a production-like version of the website on my local machine with a single command, so that I can confidently test my changes before submitting them.

- **As a DevOps Engineer,** I want to package the entire website and its web server into a single, portable container image, so that I can eliminate environment inconsistencies and create a reliable build artifact.

- **As an Engineering Manager,** I want to have a standardized, version-controlled artifact for the website, so that we can easily track what is deployed and perform instant rollbacks if needed.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### Containerization:

- A Dockerfile must be created in the root of the website's code repository.

- The Dockerfile must use a multi-stage build process to create a lean, production-ready image.
  - **Stage 1:** (If applicable for future use) A build stage to compile assets.
  - **Stage 2:** A final, lightweight stage using an official Nginx image to serve the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

- The final container image should be optimized for size.

### Local Execution:

- The website must be runnable locally via a single `docker run` command.

- The local container must be accessible in the browser (e.g., on http://localhost:8080).

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Portability:** The Docker image must be able to run on any machine with Docker installed (Linux, macOS, Windows) without modification.

- **Security:** The final image should not contain unnecessary build tools, packages, or secrets. The Nginx server should be configured with sensible defaults.

- **Developer Experience:** The process to build the image and run the container locally should be simple and clearly documented in a README.md file.

## 7. Proposed Tech Stack (Phase 1)

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Containerization | Docker | The industry standard for creating portable application containers. |
| Web Server | Nginx | A high-performance, lightweight, and reliable web server ideal for serving static content. |
| Version Control | Git / GitHub | To store the Dockerfile and website source code, enabling tracking and collaboration. |

## 8. Success Metrics

This project will be considered successful when:

- A new developer can run the entire website locally in a container within 5 minutes of cloning the repository.

- The manual SFTP deployment process is officially deprecated.

- A versioned Docker image of the website is successfully built and stored in a container registry (to be implemented in the next phase).
